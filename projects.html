    <h2>Project 1: Ethical Data Analysis App (Upcoming Project)</h2>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
      I plan to build a data visualization app that helps users understand complex data clearly while fully respecting privacy and keeping accuracy. The app will help users make good decisions without giving up important ethical standards.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
      Three.js to create interactive 3D visuals, Next.js for the frontend and server rendering, and Node.js for backend services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
      As I get ready to start this project, I know it can be easy to rush data work to meet deadlines. Thinking about Ether 12:27, I see that my main challenge will be handling pressure without losing honesty. I want to slow down, check carefully for mistakes, and focus on honest and accurate work. I believe that doing this with faith and patience will bring results that bless users in a Christlike way.

    <h2>Project 2: E Commerce Website with Integrity First Design (Upcoming Project)</h2>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
      I aim to build a secure and easy to use e-commerce platform that gives users a smooth experience while protecting their data with strong security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
      React.js to build the user interface, Node.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB to keep the database safe.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
      Before I launch important parts like the login system, I will pray for guidance and listen carefully to spiritual impressions during development. Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 reminds me to trust these feelings. This will help me catch problems early and keep security strong. I want faith to be part of every technical step because spiritual guidance helps me do my best work.

    <h2>Project 3: SSP Project – Refinement and Ethical Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tsogt Enkhbat<br />
       <strong>Date:</strong> July 2025</p>
    <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project</a></p>

    <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br />
      The SSP Project is a simple social media web app that I built two years ago using React.js and Node.js. It is similar to Twitter and allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an account</li>
      <li>Post, edit, and delete tweets</li>
      <li>Follow other users</li>
      <li>View tweets from the people they follow</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal was to learn full-stack development and practice working with user data, routing, and basic state management.</p>

    <h3>Challenges and Areas for Improvement:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Tweets can take time to load. There is no lazy loading or pagination initially.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Experience:</strong> Not fully responsive on smaller screens; buttons and text may overlap.</li>
      <li><strong>User Control:</strong> No way to delete an account or report harmful content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Users should control their data and be able to delete their accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Responsibility:</strong> A flag or report system is needed to manage harmful content.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair Usage:</strong> The app should include rate limits and explain what data is collected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Refinements and Ethical Integration:</h3>
    <p>Since the initial build, I have refined the project by adding infinite scroll using the following React component integration:</p>
    <pre style="background:#eee; padding:10px; overflow-x:auto;">
&lt;InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={tweets.length}
  next={() => setPage((page) => page + 1)}
  hasMore={hasMore}
  loader={
    &lt;div className="flex justify-center my-4 text-gray-500"&gt;
      &lt;span className="animate-pulse"&gt;Loading more tweets...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }
  scrollableTarget="tweet-main-content"
&gt;
</pre>
    <p>Additionally, I improved the responsiveness with CSS media queries to adapt the layout and hide non-essential elements on smaller screens, enhancing the mobile user experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Planned further improvements include:</strong> adding user account deletion, a reporting system for harmful content, and rate limiting to ensure fair use. These steps emphasize my commitment to respecting users’ rights and fostering a safe online environment.</p>

    <h3>Spiritual Lessons Learned:</h3>
    <p>This project taught me how to balance technical deadlines with honesty and patience. By incorporating prayer and spiritual reflection throughout development, I strengthened my commitment to ethical practices and serving others through technology.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>This project helped me understand the technical side of web development deeply. It also opened my eyes to the importance of respecting users, protecting their data, and creating a safe and ethical experience. By making these changes, I aim to improve both the function and moral integrity of the app.</p>
