      <h2>Project 1: Ethical Data Analysis App (Upcoming Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
        I plan to build a data visualization app that helps users understand complex data clearly while fully respecting privacy and maintaining accuracy. The app will empower users to make ethical, informed decisions without compromising their data rights.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
        Three.js for interactive 3D visuals, Next.js for frontend and server rendering, and Node.js for backend services.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ethical Decisions:</strong><br />
        I will avoid misleading visuals by ensuring context is always included in charts and graphs. The app will be transparent about how data is collected and used, and I will build it without collecting personally identifiable information unless strictly necessary.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
        Ether 12:27 reminds me that weakness can become strength through humility. My challenge is not letting deadlines pressure me into rushing. I plan to pause, pray, and carefully review my work with patience and integrity. I believe this will lead to results that reflect Christlike honesty and benefit others meaningfully.

      <h2>Project 2: E-Commerce Website with Integrity-First Design (Upcoming Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
        I aim to build a secure, accessible e-commerce platform that offers users a smooth experience while safeguarding their information with strong privacy and security standards.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
        React.js for the UI, Node.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB for secure and scalable data storage.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ethical Decisions:</strong><br />
        I will integrate two-factor authentication, encrypted storage for sensitive data, and clear privacy policies. I will avoid using dark UX patterns and prioritize user trust and transparency over short-term metrics.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
        Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 teaches to trust in the Spirit that “leadeth to do good.” Before deploying sensitive features like login or checkout, I’ll pray for guidance and reflect on potential risks. I trust that spiritual impressions can guide me to prevent issues before they arise and build a platform aligned with gospel-centered stewardship.

      <h2>Project 3: SSP Project – Refinement and Ethical Integration</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tsogt Enkhbat<br />
        <strong>Date:</strong> July 2025</p>
      <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project</a></p>

      <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br />
        The SSP Project is a simple social media app I built two years ago using React.js and Node.js. Inspired by Twitter, it allows users to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account</li>
        <li>Post, edit, and delete tweets</li>
        <li>Follow other users</li>
        <li>View tweets from users they follow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal was to learn full-stack development and understand how user data and state management work in real applications.</p>

      <h3>Challenges and Areas for Improvement:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Tweets load slowly without lazy loading or pagination.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Experience:</strong> Not fully responsive on small screens.</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> No account deletion or harmful content reporting features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Users deserve control over their data, including deletion options.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Responsibility:</strong> Harmful content should be reportable by users.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Usage:</strong> Rate limits should prevent abuse, and all data policies must be transparent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Refinements and Ethical Integration:</h3>
      <p>Since the initial release, I’ve made key improvements. I added infinite scroll using React components:</p>
      <pre style="background:#eee; padding:10px; overflow-x:auto;">
&lt;InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={tweets.length}
  next={() => setPage((page) => page + 1)}
  hasMore={hasMore}
  loader={
    &lt;div className="flex justify-center my-4 text-gray-500"&gt;
      &lt;span className="animate-pulse"&gt;Loading more tweets...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }
  scrollableTarget="tweet-main-content"
/&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>I also improved responsiveness using media queries to clean up the layout for mobile devices. No user tracking cookies are used. Planned updates include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a delete account option</li>
        <li>Building a reporting system for unsafe content</li>
        <li>Implementing rate limits for fair use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these changes reflects a commitment to ethical design and user protection.</p>

      <h3>Spiritual Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>When deadlines got stressful, I was tempted to skip important ethical features. But through prayer, I was reminded that my responsibility is to build tools that serve and protect people. Like in Mosiah 2:17, I saw that when I serve users righteously, I’m also serving God.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>This project helped me grow technically and spiritually. I learned how to manage user data responsibly, prioritize ethical design, and let spiritual impressions guide my decision-making. These lessons continue to shape how I build software with integrity.</p>
