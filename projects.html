      <h2>Project 1: Ethical Data Analysis App (Upcoming Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
        I plan to build a data visualization app that helps users understand complex data clearly while fully respecting privacy and maintaining accuracy. The app will empower users to make ethical, informed decisions without compromising their data rights.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
        Three.js for interactive 3D visuals, Next.js for frontend and server rendering, and Node.js for backend services.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision-Making Process:</h3>
      <p>
        During the planning phase, I carefully evaluated common pitfalls in data visualization, such as misleading scales, cherry-picking data, or displaying information without proper context. I chose Three.js to provide engaging but truthful interactive visuals and Next.js to ensure server-side rendering for fast, reliable performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I committed to not collecting personally identifiable information (PII) unless strictly necessary, recognizing the ethical importance of privacy. This led me to design strict data handling rules and opt for anonymized datasets where possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Principles Guiding Development:</h3>
      <p>
        The principles of transparency, accuracy, and respect for privacy shaped my decisions. Inspired by Ether 12:27, I understood that humility and patience are key to overcoming challenges such as deadlines that tempt shortcuts. I made a personal commitment to slow down, double-check data integrity, and be transparent about the app’s limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach reflects a gospel-centered ethic of honesty and care, ensuring that users can trust the app and use it to make decisions that align with their values.
      </p>

      <h3>Faith Reflection:</h3>
      <p>
        Ether 12:27 reminds me that through humility and faith, weaknesses can be transformed into strengths. This scripture inspires me to resist rushing and to approach each development phase prayerfully and carefully, aiming to build an app that blesses users and honors God’s standards of truth.

      <h2>Project 2: E-Commerce Website with Integrity-First Design (Upcoming Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
        I aim to build a secure, user-friendly e-commerce platform that offers a smooth shopping experience while protecting users’ data with robust privacy and security safeguards.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
        React.js for the frontend UI, Node.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB for secure, scalable data storage.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision-Making Process:</h3>
      <p>
        To prioritize user security, I planned multi-factor authentication and encrypted sensitive data storage from the outset. I reviewed UX patterns to avoid manipulative designs such as hidden fees or opt-out options, ensuring the platform fosters trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy policies will be written clearly and accessibly, giving users transparent insight into data collection and usage. During development, I will incorporate regular security audits and seek peer reviews to identify vulnerabilities early.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Principles Guiding Development:</h3>
      <p>
        The principles of respect for user autonomy, honesty, and fairness directed my choices. The Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 counsels us to “put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good,” which I interpret as inviting spiritual guidance in technical decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trust motivates me to reflect prayerfully before launching major features like login or checkout systems to avoid rushing and potential flaws. It also encourages ongoing vigilance and humility in recognizing and addressing risks.
      </p>

      <h3>Faith Reflection:</h3>
      <p>
        By seeking spiritual impressions regularly, I hope to align this project with gospel standards of stewardship, ensuring that my technical work is a form of service that protects and respects others.

      <h2>Project 3: SSP Project – Refinement and Ethical Integration</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tsogt Enkhbat<br />
         <strong>Date:</strong> July 2025</p>
      <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project</a></p>

      <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br />
        The SSP Project is a simple social media app I built two years ago using React.js and Node.js. Inspired by Twitter, it allows users to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account</li>
        <li>Post, edit, and delete tweets</li>
        <li>Follow other users</li>
        <li>View tweets from users they follow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal was to learn full-stack development and understand user data and state management in real-world applications.</p>

      <h3>Challenges and Areas for Improvement:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Initially, all tweets loaded at once, causing slow response times and poor experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Experience:</strong> The UI was not optimized for small screens, causing overlap and accessibility issues.</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> No option for account deletion or reporting harmful content, limiting user autonomy and safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical Considerations Guiding Decisions:</h3>
      <p>
        These challenges raised important ethical questions around respect for users’ autonomy, privacy, and well-being. Guided by gospel teachings such as Mosiah 2:17 (“when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God”), I considered how to best serve users responsibly through design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reflected on how to give users meaningful control over their data and a safe environment free from abuse. I also acknowledged the responsibility to maintain fairness through rate limits and clear data policies.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision-Making Process and Implementation:</h3>
      <p>
        To improve performance, I researched and selected the React <code>InfiniteScroll</code> component to load tweets incrementally, balancing efficiency and usability:
      </p>
      <pre style="background:#eee; padding:10px; overflow-x:auto;">
&lt;InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={tweets.length}
  next={() => setPage((page) => page + 1)}
  hasMore={hasMore}
  loader={
    &lt;div className="flex justify-center my-4 text-gray-500"&gt;
      &lt;span className="animate-pulse"&gt;Loading more tweets...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }
  scrollableTarget="tweet-main-content"
/&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        For mobile responsiveness, I updated CSS with media queries to optimize layout, hide non-essential elements on small screens, and improve accessibility. This choice reflects respect for diverse user contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing users’ right to privacy and safety, I began designing account deletion and content reporting features. These embody ethical principles of autonomy and harm reduction, and will be supported by transparent data use disclosures.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Principles Guiding Future Work:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Autonomy:</strong> Enabling full control over personal data, including account deletion.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and Respect:</strong> Implementing mechanisms to report and manage harmful content.</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Rate limiting to prevent misuse and ensure equitable access.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear communication of data collection and usage policies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These principles align with professional codes like the ACM Code of Ethics and gospel teachings emphasizing compassion, service, and integrity.
      </p>

      <h3>Spiritual Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        Prayer and spiritual reflection have been vital during this project’s refinement. When pressured by deadlines, I turned to Mosiah 2:17 for perspective, understanding that righteous service to users is a form of serving God. This spiritual anchor motivates me to keep ethical integrity at the core of my work.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>
        This project deepened my technical skills and spiritual understanding of ethical software development. It reaffirmed that software is not just code, but a means to serve others respectfully and honorably.
