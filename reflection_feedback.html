    <p>After getting helpful feedback and thinking about my responsibilities as a developer, I made important improvements to the SSP Project. I added infinite scroll to load tweets bit by bit, which made the app faster and easier to use. I also changed the design so it works better on phones and smaller screens. These changes helped me learn how to make the app work well for more people.</p>

    <p>I also realized it’s very important to keep users safe and give them control over their data. While I haven’t yet added features like letting users delete their accounts or report bad content, I plan to do this soon. I want to make sure the app respects people’s privacy and is a safe place to use. I also want to add limits on how often people can post and be clear about what data the app collects. These changes show I care about being fair and honest with users.</p>

    <p>Working on these improvements helped me grow not just as a coder but as a person. It reminded me to listen to advice and to follow what I feel is right, both in my work and in my faith. I want to keep building apps that are not only good technically but also kind and respectful to others.</p>
