    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

    <h3>1. Faith in Jesus Christ During Professional Growth</h3>
    <p>
      My journey as a developer has taught me that technical skill is important, but it’s not enough by itself. There are moments when even my best efforts fall short. Sometimes the server crashes unexpectedly, an API fails right before a deadline, or team conflicts slow down progress. In these moments, I’ve learned to turn to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith isn’t just for Sundays or church callings. It’s a daily practice in my career. When I pray before deploying a big project or ask for guidance during a tough meeting, I feel the Spirit remind me to stay calm and make decisions based on eternal principles, not just technical knowledge. I’ve learned to trust that the Lord cares about my work life just as much as my spiritual life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Doctrine and Covenants 11:12: Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good, which shall fill your soul with joy.</p>

    <h3>2. Integrity and Ethical Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      When working with code, data, and systems that impact real people, integrity is everything. At E-ESC LLC, I often had backend access to critical game servers. At Dentsu Data Artist Mongol, I handled AI features that connected directly to customers. I’ve seen firsthand how small ethical decisions can have long-term effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      One memory that stays with me is when a teammate copied code from a private branch without asking. At the time, I didn’t say anything, and I still regret it. I’ve reflected on that moment through scripture and prayer and realized that part of being a disciple is having the courage to speak up. Not to embarrass someone, but to protect integrity in the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I try to lead by example. I remind myself daily that integrity is about doing the right thing when no one is watching, even in small coding tasks or data decisions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Mosiah 2:17: When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>

    <h3>3. Service to Others Through Technology</h3>
    <p>
      I used to think of service as something outside of work like volunteering or doing church assignments. But I’ve come to see that my professional skills are part of my spiritual stewardship. When I help a teammate fix a bug, write clean documentation for the next developer, or design a system that protects user privacy, I’m serving.
    </p>
    <p>
      At STEPPE LINK LLC, I stayed late to help a teammate debug a WebSocket issue, even though I had my own deadlines. At first, I felt like I was wasting time. But reflecting later, I realized that Christlike service often means putting people before tasks. Now, I try to approach each project with the mindset of how I can bless others with this work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Ether 12:27: And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.</p>

  <section id="portfolio-intro">
    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Tsogt Enkhbat, and I believe that software development is about more than just code. It’s about character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my career, I’ve worked on everything from game servers and real-time dashboards to AI admin panels and e-commerce systems. But beyond the tech stack, what matters most to me is how I use these skills to serve others, build ethical systems, and grow spiritually.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio isn’t just a list of projects. It’s a record of my journey to become a disciple-developer. Someone who builds with integrity, solves problems with patience, and leads with Christlike purpose.
    </p>

  <section id="projects">
    <h2>Project Descriptions</h2>

    <h3>Project 1: Ethical Data Analysis App</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build a data visualization app that helps users see complex data clearly without compromising privacy or accuracy.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Three.js, Next.js, Node.js</p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong> When working with real user data, it’s tempting to cut corners to meet deadlines. But during this project, I paused to reflect on Ether 12:27. I realized my weakness wasn’t technical. It was rushing under pressure. By slowing down, checking for bias, and focusing on accuracy, I found that honest development is also Christlike development.</p>

    <h3>Project 2: E-Commerce Website with Integrity-First Design</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a secure, accessible e-commerce platform with a smooth user experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> React.js, Node.js, MongoDB</p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong> Before deploying the login system, I prayed for guidance. Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 reminded me to trust spiritual impressions even in coding. This led me to rethink the security layer and catch a mistake that could have left user data exposed. It taught me that faith belongs in every step of the process, even during technical testing.</p>

  <section id="ethical-dilemma">
    <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> In a past role, I saw a teammate copy code from a private branch into their own feature without giving credit.</p>
    <p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong> At first, I stayed silent. Later, the team lead addressed it privately and changed GitHub permissions, but the damage to team trust was already done.</p>
    <p><strong>Spiritual Reflection:</strong> Looking back, I realize that being a disciple-developer means standing up for integrity, even when it’s uncomfortable. Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28 teaches us to be anxiously engaged in good causes, not passive observers. Since then, I’ve made a personal commitment to kindly but clearly speak up when I see something wrong.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Activity: Temple Insights</h2>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong> I visited the temple grounds and sat quietly to think about my life as a developer, husband, and disciple. I reflected on how sometimes I separate my tech side from my spiritual side. But the Lord doesn’t see life that way. He sees it as one whole journey.</p>
    <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong> I thought about Elder Bednar’s analogy of the intertwined strands of rope. My professional work is one strand. My spiritual life is another. When they’re combined, they become stronger together. This experience helped me commit to being the same person in both realms. Honest, faithful, and focused on service.</p>
