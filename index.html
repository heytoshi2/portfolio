    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Tsogt Enkhbat, and I believe that software development is about more than just code. It’s about character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my career, I’ve worked on everything from game servers and real-time dashboards to AI admin panels and e-commerce systems. But beyond the tech stack, what matters most to me is how I use these skills to serve others, build ethical systems, and grow spiritually.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio isn’t just a list of projects. It’s a record of my journey to become a disciple-developer. Someone who builds with integrity, solves problems with patience, and leads with Christlike purpose.

    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

    <h3>1. Faith in Jesus Christ During Professional Growth</h3>
    <p>
      My journey as a developer has taught me that technical skill is important, but it’s not enough by itself. There are moments when even my best efforts fall short. Sometimes the server crashes unexpectedly, an API fails right before a deadline, or team conflicts slow down progress. In these moments, I’ve learned to turn to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith isn’t just for Sundays or church callings. It’s a daily practice in my career. When I pray before deploying a big project or ask for guidance during a tough meeting, I feel the Spirit remind me to stay calm and make decisions based on eternal principles, not just technical knowledge. I’ve learned to trust that the Lord cares about my work life just as much as my spiritual life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Doctrine and Covenants 11:12: Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good, which shall fill your soul with joy.</p>

    <h3>2. Integrity and Ethical Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      When working with code, data, and systems that impact real people, integrity is everything. At E-ESC LLC, I often had backend access to critical game servers. At Dentsu Data Artist Mongol, I handled AI features that connected directly to customers. I’ve seen firsthand how small ethical decisions can have long-term effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      One memory that stays with me is when a teammate copied code from a private branch without asking. At the time, I didn’t say anything, and I still regret it. I’ve reflected on that moment through scripture and prayer and realized that part of being a disciple is having the courage to speak up. Not to embarrass someone, but to protect integrity in the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I try to lead by example. I remind myself daily that integrity is about doing the right thing when no one is watching, even in small coding tasks or data decisions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Mosiah 2:17: When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>

    <h3>3. Service to Others Through Technology</h3>
    <p>
      I used to think of service as something outside of work like volunteering or doing church assignments. But I’ve come to see that my professional skills are part of my spiritual stewardship. When I help a teammate fix a bug, write clean documentation for the next developer, or design a system that protects user privacy, I’m serving.
    </p>
    <p>
      At STEPPE LINK LLC, I stayed late to help a teammate debug a WebSocket issue, even though I had my own deadlines. At first, I felt like I was wasting time. But reflecting later, I realized that Christlike service often means putting people before tasks. Now, I try to approach each project with the mindset of how I can bless others with this work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Ether 12:27: And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.</p>

  <h2>Project Descriptions</h2>

  <article>
    <h3>Project 1: Ethical Data Analysis App (Upcoming Project)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
      I plan to build a data visualization app that helps users understand complex data clearly while fully respecting privacy and keeping accuracy. The app will help users make good decisions without giving up important ethical standards.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
      Three.js to create interactive 3D visuals, Next.js for the frontend and server rendering, and Node.js for backend services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
      As I get ready to start this project, I know it can be easy to rush data work to meet deadlines. Thinking about Ether 12:27, I see that my main challenge will be handling pressure without losing honesty. I want to slow down, check carefully for mistakes, and focus on honest and accurate work. I believe that doing this with faith and patience will bring results that bless users in a Christlike way.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 2: E Commerce Website with Integrity First Design (Upcoming Project)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
      I aim to build a secure and easy to use e-commerce platform that gives users a smooth experience while protecting their data with strong security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
      React.js to build the user interface, Node.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB to keep the database safe.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
      Before I launch important parts like the login system, I will pray for guidance and listen carefully to spiritual impressions during development. Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 reminds me to trust these feelings. This will help me catch problems early and keep security strong. I want faith to be part of every technical step because spiritual guidance helps me do my best work.

<section id="ethical-dilemma-analysis">
  <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis</h2>
  <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br />
    While working on a team project, I saw that a teammate copied code from a private branch without asking permission or giving credit. This broke trust and raised questions about fairness and respect in the team.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong><br />
    At first, I was unsure if I should say anything. Later, the team lead found out and spoke privately with the person involved. They also changed the branch permissions to stop it from happening again. Even though the problem was fixed, it still hurt team trust and morale.
  </p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Reflection:</strong><br />
When I think back on this situation, I realize how important it is to have courage and to stay honest, both as a disciple of Christ and as a professional. Doctrine and Covenants 58:27 to 28 teaches me that I should not just stand by and watch when something is wrong. Instead, I should be anxiously engaged in doing good.
</p>

<p>
At that time, I stayed quiet because I did not want to cause problems. But by staying silent, I allowed the situation to hurt the team’s trust. After praying and thinking about it, I understand now that doing the right thing is sometimes uncomfortable, but it is necessary. I have made a promise to myself that from now on, I will kindly and respectfully speak up when I see something unethical. I want to help create teams that are built on trust and honesty because that is the right thing to do. This is also part of how I honor God through my work.

<section id="reflective-experience">
  <h2>Reflective Experience: Temple Insights</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Activity:</strong><br />
    I visited the temple grounds and found a quiet, peaceful place to sit and think about my life. As a software developer, husband, and follower of Christ, I realized I often separate my work from my faith. I wanted to understand how these parts of my life fit together and what I could learn from that.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong><br />
    I thought about what Elder Bednar said about ropes and how strands twisted together become much stronger than one strand alone. I see my job skills and my spiritual beliefs as two strands. When I put them together, they make me stronger in both areas. This helped me understand that being a good developer is not just about coding well; it is also about being honest, kind, and patient just like my faith teaches me. I want to be the same person at work and at home: someone who works hard, cares for others, and lives with faith every day.
