    <p>Spiritual Progression and Professional Growth Portfolio</p>
  </header>

  <section id="portfolio-intro">
    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Tsogt Enkhbat, and I believe that software development is about more than just code. It’s about character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my career, I’ve worked on everything from game servers and real-time dashboards to AI admin panels and e-commerce systems. But beyond the tech stack, what matters most to me is how I use these skills to serve others, build ethical systems, and grow spiritually.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio isn’t just a list of projects. It’s a record of my journey to become a disciple-developer. Someone who builds with integrity, solves problems with patience, and leads with Christlike purpose.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="enhanced-spiritual-content">
    <h2>Deeper Spiritual Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have encountered moments where my faith was tested alongside my professional skills. For example, during a critical project deadline, I faced unexpected setbacks. Instead of succumbing to stress, I chose to pray and seek patience. This experience strengthened my testimony that Christ’s guidance transcends every aspect of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, “The future is as bright as your faith.” This has inspired me to approach challenges with hope and perseverance, knowing that my work can be a form of worship and service.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="competency-spiritual-alignment">
    <h2>Professional Competencies Aligned with Spiritual Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      My skills in software development, such as problem-solving, collaboration, and ethical coding reflect spiritual principles like patience, honesty, and service. When I debug code, I practice patience; when I collaborate with teammates, I demonstrate charity; and when I handle sensitive data, I uphold integrity as taught in the scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This integration motivates me to be a disciple not only in faith but in my professional life, making every project an opportunity to serve others and glorify God.

    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

    <h3>1. Faith in Jesus Christ During Professional Growth</h3>
    <p>
      My journey as a developer has taught me that technical skill is important, but it’s not enough by itself. There are moments when even my best efforts fall short. Sometimes the server crashes unexpectedly, an API fails right before a deadline, or team conflicts slow down progress. In these moments, I’ve learned to turn to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith isn’t just for Sundays or church callings. It’s a daily practice in my career. When I pray before deploying a big project or ask for guidance during a tough meeting, I feel the Spirit remind me to stay calm and make decisions based on eternal principles, not just technical knowledge. I’ve learned to trust that the Lord cares about my work life just as much as my spiritual life.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Doctrine and Covenants 11:12: Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good, which shall fill your soul with joy.</p>

    <h3>2. Integrity and Ethical Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      When working with code, data, and systems that impact real people, integrity is everything. At E-ESC LLC, I often had backend access to critical game servers. At Dentsu Data Artist Mongol, I handled AI features that connected directly to customers. I’ve seen firsthand how small ethical decisions can have long-term effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      One memory that stays with me is when a teammate copied code from a private branch without asking. At the time, I didn’t say anything, and I still regret it. I’ve reflected on that moment through scripture and prayer and realized that part of being a disciple is having the courage to speak up. Not to embarrass someone, but to protect integrity in the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I try to lead by example. I remind myself daily that integrity is about doing the right thing when no one is watching, even in small coding tasks or data decisions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Mosiah 2:17: When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>

    <h3>3. Service to Others Through Technology</h3>
    <p>
      I used to think of service as something outside of work like volunteering or doing church assignments. But I’ve come to see that my professional skills are part of my spiritual stewardship. When I help a teammate fix a bug, write clean documentation for the next developer, or design a system that protects user privacy, I’m serving.
    </p>
    <p>
      At STEPPE LINK LLC, I stayed late to help a teammate debug a WebSocket issue, even though I had my own deadlines. At first, I felt like I was wasting time. But reflecting later, I realized that Christlike service often means putting people before tasks. Now, I try to approach each project with the mindset of how I can bless others with this work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Ether 12:27: And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.</p>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
        As I get ready to start this project, I know it can be easy to rush data work to meet deadlines. Thinking about Ether 12:27, I see that my main challenge will be handling pressure without losing honesty. I want to slow down, check carefully for mistakes, and focus on honest and accurate work. I believe that doing this with faith and patience will bring results that bless users in a Christlike way.

      <h3>Project 2: E Commerce Website with Integrity First Design (Upcoming Project)</h3>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
        I aim to build a secure and easy to use e-commerce platform that gives users a smooth experience while protecting their data with strong security.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools Planned:</strong><br />
        React.js to build the user interface, Node.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB to keep the database safe.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Faith Reflection:</strong><br />
        Before I launch important parts like the login system, I will pray for guidance and listen carefully to spiritual impressions during development. Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 reminds me to trust these feelings. This will help me catch problems early and keep security strong. I want faith to be part of every technical step because spiritual guidance helps me do my best work.

      <h3>Project 3: SSP Project – Refinement and Ethical Integration</h3>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tsogt Enkhbat<br />
        <strong>Date:</strong> July 2025</p>
      <p><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/heytoshi/SSP-Project</a></p>

      <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br />
        The SSP Project is a simple social media web app that I built two years ago using React.js and Node.js. It is similar to Twitter and allows users to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account</li>
        <li>Post, edit, and delete tweets</li>
        <li>Follow other users</li>
        <li>View tweets from the people they follow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal was to learn full-stack development and practice working with user data, routing, and basic state management.</p>

      <p><strong>Challenges and Areas for Improvement:</strong><br />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Tweets can take time to load. There is no lazy loading or pagination initially.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile Experience:</strong> Not fully responsive on smaller screens; buttons and text may overlap.</li>
          <li><strong>User Control:</strong> No way to delete an account or report harmful content.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong><br />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Users should control their data and be able to delete their accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Responsibility:</strong> A flag or report system is needed to manage harmful content.</li>
          <li><strong>Fair Usage:</strong> The app should include rate limits and explain what data is collected.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Refinements and Ethical Integration:</strong><br />
        Since the initial build, I have refined the project by adding infinite scroll using the following React component integration:
      </p>
      <pre style="background:#eee; padding:10px; overflow-x:auto;">
&lt;InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={tweets.length}
  next={() => setPage((page) => page + 1)}
  hasMore={hasMore}
  loader={
    &lt;div className="flex justify-center my-4 text-gray-500"&gt;
      &lt;span className="animate-pulse"&gt;Loading more tweets...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  }
  scrollableTarget="tweet-main-content"
&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
        Additionally, I improved the responsiveness with CSS media queries to adapt the layout and hide non-essential elements on smaller screens, enhancing the mobile user experience.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4ZdS6yjb/Screenshot-2025-07-27-at-4-30-22-PM.png" 
     alt="Mobile responsive layout screenshot" 
     style="max-width: 100%; height: 400px; margin-top: 10px;" />
      <p>
        Planned further improvements include adding user account deletion, a reporting system for harmful content, and rate limiting to ensure fair use. These steps emphasize my commitment to respecting users’ rights and fostering a safe online environment.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Spiritual Lessons Learned:</strong><br />
        This project taught me how to balance technical deadlines with honesty and patience. By incorporating prayer and spiritual reflection throughout development, I strengthened my commitment to ethical practices and serving others through technology.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
        This project helped me understand the technical side of web development deeply. It also opened my eyes to the importance of respecting users, protecting their data, and creating a safe and ethical experience. By making these changes, I aim to improve both the function and moral integrity of the app.

    <h2>Peer-Review Evaluation</h2>
    <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Taylor Muhlestein<br />
       <strong>Date:</strong> 7/24/2025<br />
       <strong>Peer:</strong> Tsogt Enkhbat
    </p>

    <h3>1. Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Tsogt’s SSP Project is a compact version of Twitter built using React.js and Node.js. Users can create accounts, post tweets, edit or delete them, follow others, and see posts from people they follow. It’s a solid foundation for a social media app, especially for something built solo a couple years back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goals are clearly stated, and the features are well thought out. It’s great that he’s already thinking about ways to improve things like performance and mobile responsiveness, it shows he’s not just stopping at “it works,” but wants to make it better.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Technical Assessment</h3>
    <p>
      From a technical perspective, it’s clear Tsogt knows what he’s doing. The use of React and Node is pretty standard for this kind of project, and it sounds like the core functionality is working well. The fact that he's already reflecting on how to make things faster and more mobile-friendly shows a good developer mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding in some scalability improvements like lazy loading or pagination could help with performance. And throwing in responsive design tweaks would make it much smoother on phones.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Ethics and User Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      This part really stood out. A lot of people ignore ethics in small projects, but Tsogt’s already thinking about user data, content safety, and fair treatment. That’s a big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mentions things like letting users delete their data, avoiding unnecessary data collection, and letting people report harmful content. These are great considerations and totally in line with modern expectations, even if the app isn’t huge.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Suggestions and Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Try adding pagination or infinite scroll to help load tweets faster.</li>
      <li>Improve responsiveness so it works better on different screen sizes, especially phones.</li>
      <li>A simple content report or flagging system could go a long way for moderation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, this is a well-built, thoughtful project. Tsogt shows he’s got both the technical chops and the awareness to think about the real-world impact of what he builds. With a few updates, especially around mobile support and moderation tools, this could go from a good student project to something really polished.

  <section id="ethical-dilemma-analysis">
    <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Early in my career, I faced an ethical dilemma when a teammate copied code from a private branch without permission. At the time, I didn’t speak up because I feared confrontation, but I regret that decision. I have since learned that integrity means addressing such issues with courage and kindness.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Alternative Actions Considered:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignoring the issue to avoid conflict, which risks undermining team trust.</li>
      <li>Confronting the teammate publicly, which might embarrass them and damage relationships.</li>
      <li>Privately discussing the concern with the teammate to encourage honesty and teamwork.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>
      The best approach is the private conversation. This respects the individual, protects team integrity, and fosters an environment where ethical behavior is encouraged without shame. This aligns with my belief that leadership requires compassion and the courage to uphold standards.
    </p>
  </section>

<section id="project-refinements-report">
  <h2>Project Refinements and Ethical Integration Report</h2>
  <p>
    After getting helpful feedback and thinking about my responsibilities as a developer, I made important improvements to the SSP Project. I added infinite scroll to load tweets bit by bit, which made the app faster and easier to use. I also changed the design so it works better on phones and smaller screens. These changes helped me learn how to make the app work well for more people.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also realized it’s very important to keep users safe and give them control over their data. While I haven’t yet added features like letting users delete their accounts or report bad content, I plan to do this soon. I want to make sure the app respects people’s privacy and is a safe place to use. I also want to add limits on how often people can post and be clear about what data the app collects. These changes show I care about being fair and honest with users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working on these improvements helped me grow not just as a coder but as a person. It reminded me to listen to advice and to follow what I feel is right, both in my work and in my faith. I want to keep building apps that are not only good technically but also kind and respectful to others.
