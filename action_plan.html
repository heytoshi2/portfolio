  <h1>Detailed Action Plan for Ongoing Spiritual and Professional Development</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Spiritual Development Goals</h2>
    <p>My spiritual journey has been deeply shaped by moments of challenge and faith, such as when I struggled with a difficult software class last year and experienced what I believe was a miracle in my final grade. This experience taught me the power of perseverance, prayer, and trusting in the Lord’s timing. To continue growing spiritually, I will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily Scripture Study and Prayer:</strong> Dedicate 20 minutes each morning to study the Book of Mormon and pray. This will help me strengthen my connection to Christ and gain guidance for daily challenges, both personal and professional.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly Reflection Journal:</strong> Write weekly journal entries reflecting on how I am applying Christlike attributes such as patience, humility, and diligence in my life. This will include reflecting on moments when I overcome frustrations, like debugging complex code or handling setbacks in my projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Service and Teaching:</strong> Actively seek opportunities to serve others, both within my faith community and in my professional field, such as mentoring peers or volunteering to help others with technology. I want to follow Christ’s example of loving service.</li>
      <li><strong>Faith in Action:</strong> During times of stress or doubt, especially when balancing school, work, and family, I will rely on prayer and scripture to find peace and strength, just as I did during my challenging class experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Development Goals</h2>
    <p>My passion for technology and software development has grown through projects like the SSP Twitter clone and my involvement in startups. These experiences have shown me the importance of continuous learning, ethical responsibility, and balancing technical skills with personal integrity. To advance professionally, I will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Complete at least two professional certifications over the next year, such as AWS Cloud Practitioner and a cybersecurity fundamentals course, to deepen my technical expertise and stay current with industry trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Ethical Awareness:</strong> Incorporate ethical considerations into every project, ensuring user privacy and data security are prioritized. I will document ethical dilemmas I face and reflect on how to resolve them responsibly.</li>
      <li><strong>Networking and Mentoring:</strong> Attend at least three industry events or webinars each year to connect with professionals and potential mentors. Additionally, I will mentor junior students or peers, sharing knowledge and encouraging their growth as I have benefited from support in my own journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Develop Soft Skills:</strong> Work on communication, teamwork, and leadership skills by actively participating in group projects and seeking leadership roles, preparing myself to be a trusted and effective professional in the IT field.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Balance work, study, and family by using tools like calendars and task lists, applying lessons learned from my experience juggling difficult courses while maintaining faith and family responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Accountability and Review</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain a monthly review journal combining spiritual reflections and professional progress, identifying successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.</li>
      <li>Seek quarterly feedback from trusted mentors, professors, and supervisors to gain perspective and adjust goals as needed.</li>
      <li>Set an annual review to assess my overall growth, update my action plan, and set new goals aligned with evolving personal values and career aspirations.</li>
    </ul>
