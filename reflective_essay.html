  <h1>Reflective Essay on Portfolio Alignment and Goal Evolution</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Throughout my spiritual and professional journey, I have come to realize how deeply intertwined these two aspects of my life are. My résumé highlights technical skills and accomplishments I have worked hard to achieve, but my spiritual progression portfolio reveals the faith, perseverance, and character development that have fueled my success. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My work experience as a Fullstack Developer, leading backend API development and scaling game servers, has challenged me to be diligent, adaptable, and responsible. However, my spiritual experiences—especially moments when I faced setbacks like a low midterm grade despite hard studying—taught me the importance of patience and trust in God’s timing. These trials refined my humility and strengthened my resolve to keep progressing both spiritually and professionally.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ethical reflections I explored in my portfolio directly relate to my career responsibilities. For example, in my roles maintaining user data and building responsive interfaces, I learned the significance of protecting users’ privacy and designing with integrity. These values come from my commitment to Christlike attributes such as honesty and service, which I continually cultivate in my daily life and work.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I reviewed my portfolio, I saw my goals evolve from focusing mainly on technical competence to embracing a holistic vision where spiritual growth and professional excellence reinforce each other. This integrated approach motivates me to not only develop software skills but also to lead with kindness, serve my colleagues, and face challenges with courage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving forward, my plan includes continuing to deepen my spiritual practices like prayer and scripture study, alongside advancing technical expertise in cloud services and scalable architectures. I want to mentor others in ethical software development and be a trusted professional who contributes positively to my workplace and community. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, this portfolio is a reflection of my journey—both the technical milestones on my résumé and the quiet moments of faith that sustain me. My professional achievements are meaningful because they are grounded in spiritual principles, and my spiritual growth is enriched by the skills and opportunities my career provides. Together, they shape the person I strive to become.
