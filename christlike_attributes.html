  <h1>Christlike Attributes & Warning Signs</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Using Christlike Attributes in My Work</h2>
    <p>
      As I grow in my career as a software developer, I realize that technical skills are just one part of the picture. Showing Christlike qualities helps me be a better worker and teammate. Some important qualities I focus on are patience, honesty, humility, kindness, and service.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, patience helps me stay calm when I face bugs or unexpected problems, especially when deadlines are tight. Instead of getting frustrated, I try to take a step back, pray, and work through the issue carefully. Honesty means I admit when I don’t know something or when I make mistakes, so my team can trust me and we can fix problems together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humility reminds me that I am always learning and that I need advice and help from others. Kindness shows when I listen carefully to my teammates and help users by thinking about how they will feel using my work. I also see my job as a way to serve others by building systems that protect people’s data and create positive experiences.

    <h2>Recognizing Warning Signs</h2>
    <p>
      It’s important for me to watch for signs that I am drifting away from these values. When I feel stressed or rushed, I sometimes get impatient or want to skip steps to finish faster. These moments remind me to slow down and remember that doing what is right is more important than just finishing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I skip prayer or quiet time before starting work, and I notice that I feel less peaceful and more confused. There are times when success makes me feel too proud or confident, and I don’t listen to feedback from others. Feeling disconnected from my faith or isolated from my team are also signs I need to pause and refocus on what matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing these warning signs helps me stay honest with myself and others, and keeps me growing both spiritually and professionally.

    <h2>Reflection and Finishing My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      This portfolio is not just a list of projects or skills. It is a story of how I am becoming the kind of developer who works with honesty, care, and faith. I want others to see not only what I can do but also who I am becoming through my work and beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When building this portfolio, I focused on being clear, organized, and respectful. I separated the content into parts so people can easily find what they need, whether it’s about my technical skills or my spiritual journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue to grow, I plan to update this portfolio to show new skills, projects, and lessons. It will help remind me to keep Christ at the center of my work, to serve others, and to always act with integrity.
