    <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Tsogt’s SSP Project is a compact version of Twitter built using React.js and Node.js. Users can create accounts, post tweets, edit or delete them, follow others, and see posts from people they follow. It’s a solid foundation for a social media app, especially for something built solo a couple years back.</p>
    <p>The goals are clearly stated, and the features are well thought out. It’s great that he’s already thinking about ways to improve things like performance and mobile responsiveness, it shows he’s not just stopping at “it works,” but wants to make it better.</p>

    <h2>2. Technical Assessment</h2>
    <p>From a technical perspective, it’s clear Tsogt knows what he’s doing. The use of React and Node is pretty standard for this kind of project, and it sounds like the core functionality is working well. The fact that he's already reflecting on how to make things faster and more mobile-friendly shows a good developer mindset.</p>
    <p>Adding in some scalability improvements like lazy loading or pagination could help with performance. And throwing in responsive design tweaks would make it much smoother on phones.</p>

    <h2>3. Ethics and User Considerations</h2>
    <p>This part really stood out. A lot of people ignore ethics in small projects, but Tsogt’s already thinking about user data, content safety, and fair treatment. That’s a big deal.</p>
    <p>He mentions things like letting users delete their data, avoiding unnecessary data collection, and letting people report harmful content. These are great considerations and totally in line with modern expectations, even if the app isn’t huge.</p>

    <h2>4. Suggestions and Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Try adding pagination or infinite scroll to help load tweets faster.</li>
      <li>Improve responsiveness so it works better on different screen sizes, especially phones.</li>
      <li>A simple content report or flagging system could go a long way for moderation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Overall, this is a well-built, thoughtful project. Tsogt shows he’s got both the technical chops and the awareness to think about the real-world impact of what he builds. With a few updates, especially around mobile support and moderation tools, this could go from a good student project to something really polished.</p>
