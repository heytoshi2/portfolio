    <h2>Career & Projects</h2>
    <p>Early in my career, I faced an ethical dilemma when a teammate copied code from a private branch without permission. At the time, I didnâ€™t speak up because I feared confrontation, but I regret that decision. I have since learned that integrity means addressing such issues with courage and kindness.</p>

    <h3>Alternative Actions Considered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignoring the issue to avoid conflict, which risks undermining team trust.</li>
      <li>Confronting the teammate publicly, which might embarrass them and damage relationships.</li>
      <li>Privately discussing the concern with the teammate to encourage honesty and teamwork.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
    <p>The best approach is the private conversation. This respects the individual, protects team integrity, and fosters an environment where ethical behavior is encouraged without shame. This aligns with my belief that leadership requires compassion and the courage to uphold standards.</p>

   <h2>Portfolio</h2>

  <p>
    While developing and refining this portfolio, I faced an ethical dilemma related to balancing transparency and privacy. On one hand, I wanted to showcase detailed project experiences and personal reflections to provide an honest and comprehensive view of my growth. On the other hand, I had to ensure I did not disclose sensitive information or unintentionally share private data about collaborators or users involved in my projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Initially, I struggled with how much detail to include, worrying that either too little transparency would seem vague, or too much detail might violate privacy or confidentiality agreements. After reflecting on ethical principles and consulting guidelines on professional integrity, I chose to focus on describing technical and spiritual lessons learned without revealing private or proprietary details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This approach respects the trust others have placed in me while still allowing me to present my authentic journey. It reinforced the importance of integrity and respect for others in all aspects of my work, including how I communicate and document my experiences.
