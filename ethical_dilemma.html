    <h2>Career & Projects</h2>
    <p>During one of my early software development internships, I was part of a team working on a private internal tool. A teammate, under pressure to meet a deadline, copied code from another developer’s private branch without permission and merged it into our shared repository. The original developer had marked the code as unfinished, and it wasn’t ready for production. I discovered this during a code review but felt conflicted about whether to speak up.</p>

    <h3>Alternative Actions Considered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignore the issue to avoid conflict, which might allow unethical behavior to go unchecked.</li>
      <li>Report the issue to the team lead immediately, which could damage the teammate’s reputation.</li>
      <li>Privately speak to the teammate, giving them the opportunity to take responsibility and correct the mistake themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implemented Approach:</h3>
    <p>
      After praying and reflecting on Christlike principles such as meekness and accountability, I decided to speak with the teammate privately. I explained what I noticed and how it could impact the team’s trust and code quality. Thankfully, they admitted the mistake and agreed to notify the lead and revert the changes. This helped resolve the issue without creating tension in the team.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection and Alignment with Principles:</h3>
    <p>
      This experience taught me that ethical leadership requires both courage and compassion. Professionally, I followed the <em>ACM Code of Ethics</em>, which emphasizes honesty, respect, and responsibility. Spiritually, I was inspired by a verse in the Book of Mormon: “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness” (Ether 12:27). That scripture reminded me that we all have weaknesses, but they can lead to growth when addressed with humility. By approaching the situation with love and integrity, I honored both my faith and my professional responsibility.

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      While developing and refining this portfolio, I faced an ethical dilemma related to balancing transparency and privacy. On one hand, I wanted to showcase detailed project experiences and personal reflections to provide an honest and comprehensive view of my growth. On the other hand, I had to ensure I did not disclose sensitive information or unintentionally share private data about collaborators or users involved in my projects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Initially, I struggled with how much detail to include, worrying that either too little transparency would seem vague, or too much detail might violate privacy or confidentiality agreements. After reflecting on ethical principles and consulting guidelines on professional integrity, I chose to focus on describing technical and spiritual lessons learned without revealing private or proprietary details.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This approach respects the trust others have placed in me while still allowing me to present my authentic journey. It reinforced the importance of integrity and respect for others in all aspects of my work, including how I communicate and document my experiences.
