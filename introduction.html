    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Tsogt Enkhbat, and I believe that software development is about more than just code. It’s about character.</p>
    <p>In my career, I’ve worked on everything from game servers and real-time dashboards to AI admin panels and e-commerce systems. But beyond the tech stack, what matters most to me is how I use these skills to serve others, build ethical systems, and grow spiritually.</p>
    <p>This portfolio isn’t just a list of projects. It’s a record of my journey to become a disciple-developer. Someone who builds with integrity, solves problems with patience, and leads with Christlike purpose.</p>

    <h2>Deeper Spiritual Reflections</h2>
    <p>Over the years, I have encountered moments where my faith was tested alongside my professional skills. For example, during a critical project deadline, I faced unexpected setbacks. Instead of succumbing to stress, I chose to pray and seek patience. This experience strengthened my testimony that Christ’s guidance transcends every aspect of life.</p>
    <p>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, “The future is as bright as your faith.” This has inspired me to approach challenges with hope and perseverance, knowing that my work can be a form of worship and service.</p>

    <h2>Professional Competencies Aligned with Spiritual Beliefs</h2>
    <p>My skills in software development, such as problem-solving, collaboration, and ethical coding reflect spiritual principles like patience, honesty, and service. When I debug code, I practice patience; when I collaborate with teammates, I demonstrate charity; and when I handle sensitive data, I uphold integrity as taught in the scriptures.</p>
    <p>This integration motivates me to be a disciple not only in faith but in my professional life, making every project an opportunity to serve others and glorify God.</p>
