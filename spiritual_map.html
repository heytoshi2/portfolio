    <p>
      While working on projects like gaming servers at E-ESC and web tools for Toyota at Dentsu, I often felt the pressure to deliver fast and make things perfect. After attending the temple, I realized how important it is to slow down and remember that my work should reflect my faith. Being honest in coding, treating teammates with kindness, and staying calm during server failures or client requests all tie back to Christlike attributes. In fast-paced tech jobs, it’s easy to get impatient or prideful. But when I pause and pray, I find peace and better focus. My goal is to serve others through my skills, not just build high-performing systems.
