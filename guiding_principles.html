    <h2>1. Faith in Jesus Christ During Professional Growth</h2>
    <p>
      My journey as a developer has taught me that technical skill is important, but it’s not enough by itself. There are moments when even my best efforts fall short. Sometimes the server crashes unexpectedly, an API fails right before a deadline, or team conflicts slow down progress. In these moments, I’ve learned to turn to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith isn’t just for Sundays or church callings. It’s a daily practice in my career. When I pray before deploying a big project or ask for guidance during a tough meeting, I feel the Spirit remind me to stay calm and make decisions based on eternal principles, not just technical knowledge. I’ve learned to trust that the Lord cares about my work life just as much as my spiritual life.

    <h2>2. Integrity and Ethical Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      When working with code, data, and systems that impact real people, integrity is everything. At E-ESC LLC, I often had backend access to critical game servers. At Dentsu Data Artist Mongol, I handled AI features that connected directly to customers. I’ve seen firsthand how small ethical decisions can have long-term effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      One memory that stays with me is when a teammate copied code from a private branch without asking. At the time, I didn’t say anything, and I still regret it. I’ve reflected on that moment through scripture and prayer and realized that part of being a disciple is having the courage to speak up. Not to embarrass someone, but to protect integrity in the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I try to lead by example. I remind myself daily that integrity is about doing the right thing when no one is watching, even in small coding tasks or data decisions.

    <h2>3. Service to Others Through Technology</h2>
    <p>
      I used to think of service as something outside of work like volunteering or doing church assignments. But I’ve come to see that my professional skills are part of my spiritual stewardship. When I help a teammate fix a bug, write clean documentation for the next developer, or design a system that protects user privacy, I’m serving.
    </p>
    <p>
      At STEPPE LINK LLC, I stayed late to help a teammate debug a WebSocket issue, even though I had my own deadlines. At first, I felt like I was wasting time. But reflecting later, I realized that Christlike service often means putting people before tasks. Now, I try to approach each project with the mindset of how I can bless others with this work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Supporting Scripture:</strong> Ether 12:27: And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.</p>
