  <h1>Usability Testing Report</h1>

  <p>
    I conducted usability testing on this portfolio website to ensure that users can easily navigate and understand the content, focusing on accessibility, clarity, and overall user experience. Testing involved 5 participants from diverse backgrounds, including both technical and non-technical users.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Users found the categorization intuitive but suggested adding breadcrumb trails or clearer back navigation for easier movement between sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Experience:</strong> Some users experienced layout issues on small screens, such as overlapping text or cramped menus.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Readability:</strong> While the content is detailed and meaningful, a few users recommended breaking up long paragraphs and adding more headings for scanning.</li>
    <li><strong>Load Performance:</strong> The site loaded quickly, though some CSS animations caused slight delays on older devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> The minimalist style was appreciated for its clarity, but some users suggested a bit more contrast between links and text for better visibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Enhancements Made:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Separated the original single HTML file into multiple categorized pages to improve content organization and reduce page load times.</li>
    <li>Improved mobile responsiveness using CSS media queries to adapt layouts, font sizes, and navigation for smaller screens.</li>
    <li>Added clearer navigation aids including “Back to Home” links on all pages and grouped related content with logical menus.</li>
    <li>Reformatted long text sections into smaller paragraphs with subheadings for easier reading and scanning.</li>
    <li>Increased link color contrast for better accessibility and readability.</li>
    <li>Simplified CSS animations to improve load performance on slower devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These enhancements aim to make the portfolio more user-friendly, accessible, and engaging for all viewers, whether prospective employers, peers, or mentors.
